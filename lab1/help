This project helps you understand more and deeper about 
the process concepts, how to create and terminate process. 
Also you will get familiar with system calls related to 
process and file operations. In addition, you are exposed 
to signal handling in this project. Last but not least, 
you will have your own baby -- a simple functioning shell
program with a persistent history feature.

How to Use the Simple Test Cases:

1. Copy `test' directory into your home directory by

$ cp -r test ~/

2. Copy YOUR MODIFIED `shell.c' into the test directory by

$ cp shell.c ~/test/

3. Compile your `shell.c' in test directory, you can use
makefile if you like, or simply use

$ gcc -g shell.c -o mysh 

Now, if there is no error, you can begin to test your small
shell, ;-).

$ ./mysh

* Simple Test Cases

----
COMMAND-> mv readme help 
Output: The `readme' file in the `test' directory should be
renamed into `help'.
----

----
COMMAND-> cat help 
Output: The content of this file should be printed onto the
screen.
----

----
COMMAND-> ./mysh
Output: Start a second `mysh' shell in the first `mysh' shell.
The command prompt should be waiting for user's input.  When 
you press `Ctrl+d', you should go back into your first `mysh', 
still having a "COMMAND-> " waiting for input.
----

* NOTES

If your small shell can pass the above three test cases, 
congratulations!  You already have a good start point. Remember,
I have some hard test cases for grading purpose, so before you submit
your program, test it carefully.
